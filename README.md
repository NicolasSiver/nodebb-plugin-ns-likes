## Themes

Installation of plugin is pretty straightforward. You should add template import to `Post Template`. For example, you can find `post template` for **Persona Theme** under this path: `nodebb-theme-persona/templates/partials/topic/post.tpl`

Import:

    <!-- IMPORT partials/topic/likes_post.tpl -->
    
Add it wherever you like, but don't forget to delete default one, with chevrons.

## Screenshots
