# NodeBB Likes
Traditional Like system, as you can find on social networks. It uses same reputation system.

## Themes

Installation of plugin is pretty straightforward. You should add template import to `Post Template`. For example, you can find `post template` for **Persona Theme** under this path: `nodebb-theme-persona/templates/partials/topic/post.tpl`

Import:

    <!-- IMPORT partials/topic/likes_post.tpl -->
    
Add it wherever you like, but don't forget to delete default one, with chevrons.

## View

By default, it looks like:

## TODO 

- Another style for zero votes
- Add links to user list
- Update user list if It's opened
